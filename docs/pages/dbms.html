<h1>DBMS (Future)</h1>
<p>
  The <code>dbms/</code> package is a placeholder for future database-related functionality (e.g., indexing, search,
  advanced traceability, or analytics). Current versions do not rely on a database.
</p>

<h2>Planned Directions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Derived indexes for SRS references and link graphs.</li>
  <li>History analytics across branches and releases.</li>
  <li>Team dashboards surfaced via API/CLI.</li>
</ul>
